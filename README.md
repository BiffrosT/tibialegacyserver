# Tibia Legacy Server

Tibia Legacy Server is a OpenTibia 7.72 real map server, that try to mimic every aspect of the game as it was in the year of 2006.
 
### Why 7.72?

The choice of protocol 7.72 instead of the more popular 7.4 version was guided by the move available resources to come up with a close to perfect 7.72 server. The protocol 7.4 client had a lot of flaws, making 7.4 servers nowadays being actually 7.72 servers mimicking 7.4 gameplay and graphics. There is a great number of resources to make a 7.72 server more real, as 7.7 CipSoft files were leaked. There is also a decent engine for 7.72, OTHire and a lot of datapacks available to pick stuff already done from.
