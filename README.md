# Tibia Legacy Server
>an OpenTibia 7.72 real map server

##.:: Features ::.

Tibia Legacy Server is a OpenTibia 7.72 real map server, that try to mimic every aspect of the game as it is in the year of 2006. The choice of protocol 7.72 instead of the more popular 7.4 version was guided by the move available resouces to come up with a close to perfect 7.72 server. The protocol 7.4 client had a lot of flaws, making 7.4 servers nowadays being actually 7.72 servers mimicking 7.4 gameplay and graphics. There is a great number of resources to make a 7.72 server more real, as 7.7 CipSoft files were leaked. There is also a decent engine for 7.72, OTHire and a lot of datapacks available to pick stuff already done from.
